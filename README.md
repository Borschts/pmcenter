## Setting Up Your Own `pmcenter`

The following content will guide you through the installation process.

### Prerequisites

- Microsoft .NET Core (Runtime / SDK)
- Git (optional, not needed if you uses the binaries)

For officially supported operating systems, see [here](https://see.wtf/XxTlf).

For NOT officially supported operating systems, see [here](https://see.wtf/sIjUZ).

For Arch Linux, there's an official package.

For `Raspian` or other distributions based on `armv7` architecture, run this following script as `root`:

```bash
apt-get install curl libunwind8 gettext
curl -sSL -o dotnet.tar.gz https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/1/7/917308D9-6C92-4DA5-B4B1-B4A19451E2D2/dotnet-runtime-2.1.0-linux-arm.tar.gz
mkdir -p /opt/dotnet && sudo tar zxf dotnet.tar.gz -C /opt/dotnet
ln -s /opt/dotnet/dotnet /usr/local/bin
rm dotnet.tar.gz
dotnet --info
```

### Build `pmcenter` Yourself

**You need to install .NET Core _SDK_ and _Runtime_ to finish this.**

Run this script to clone, build and initiate your own `pmcenter`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Elepover/pmcenter.git --depth=1
cd pmcenter/pmcenter
dotnet restore
dotnet publish --configuration Release
cp -R bin/Release/netcoreapp2.1/publish ../
cd .. && mv publish build
cd build
dotnet pmcenter.dll
```

The compiled binaries will be put in the `pmcenter/build` folder in your working directory.

### Use Pre-compiled Binaries

**Only .NET Core _Runtime_ is required in this step.**

Run this script to download and initiate your own `pmcenter`:

```bash
mkdir pmcenter
cd pmcenter
wget https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/Elepover/pmcenter/artifacts/pmcenter.zip
unzip pmcenter.zip
dotnet pmcenter.dll
```

### Use Docker

DO NOT COPY & PASTE. You need to edit it before executing.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elepover/pmcenter/master/Dockfile
docker build . -t pmcenter
docker run -v PATH_OF_YOUR_pmcenter.json:/opt/pmcenter/pmcenter.json pmcenter
```

That's all.

## Configuring

During the first run, `pmcenter` will automatically generate the `pmcenter.json` and `pmcenter_locale.json` file for you. Change the settings to set up.

Or, use setup wizard:

`dotnet pmcenter.dll --setup`

*Note: Running `pmcenter` with `root` privileges is STRONGLY UNRECOMMENDED. We recommend you run pmcenter as a regular user.*
